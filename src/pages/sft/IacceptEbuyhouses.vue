      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tx-p">When using the services, you may be asked to provide personal information about yourself, such as your name, contact information, payment information, details about your home or properties you are interested in, as well as financial information. This may occur, for example, when you register on the website, claim a home, share or save a property, correspond with a real estate professional (such as a real estate agent or broker, mortgage lender or loan officer, property manager, investor, homebuilder, or others) via these services, or complete other forms or transactions, such as a request for loan information or a rental housing and background check application. You may also provide information about a third party through these services, i.e. if you share a real estate listing with a recipient via email. We may combine this information with other information we collect from your interaction with these services as well as from other companies.</p>
    <p class="tx-p">Some information you provide through these services is collected and processed by third parties on our behalf. For example, when you order products or services through these services, we may need to collect your credit or debit card information. This information is collected and processed by third-party payment processors. In the event that a credit report is required to use a service, you may be asked to provide your Social Security number ("SSN"). When SSNs are required, we use technology to pass that information directly to the third-party providers who need the information to process the credit or background check report.</p>

However, if you choose to disable cookies, many of the free features of these services will not operate properly.</p>
    <p class="tx-p">The pages on the services may also include web beacons or pixels, which are electronic files to count users who have visited that page, to track activity over time and across different websites, to determine users&rsquo; interactions with emails we send, to identify certain cookies on the computer or other electronic device accessing that page, or to collect other related information, and this information may be associated with your unique browser, device identifier, or Internet Protocol address.
